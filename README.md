## Music

This project is intended to be used with a music file. You will need to provide your own music file in mp3 format.

1.  Find a music file in `.mp3` format.
2.  Rename the file to `letter-music.mp3`.
3.  Place the file in the `music` directory of this project.

The audio player is set to autoplay and loop the music. You can change these settings in the `index.html` file.

## How to Use

2.  Add your music file (see above).
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
